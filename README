AutoSave - Automatic Saves for Bukkit, a Minecraft Server Mod
http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/4316/
===============================================================================

=============================
Installing
=============================
Simple copy AutoSave.jar to your <bukkit-directory>/plugins/ and then start
Bukkit!  Most configuration of the plugin can be done via in-game commands.
For those adventurous or for changes requiring editing of the config file, it
is required to edit the config while the plugin is not running.  The best way
is to stop Bukkit, edit the file, and then start Bukkit.  It is not supported
to edit while the plugin is running!
